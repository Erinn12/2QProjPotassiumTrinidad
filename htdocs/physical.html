                <h3>What is Physical Care and Why is it Important?</h3>
                <p>Physical health is an essential part of self-care. It can boost your mood and clear your head. Physical activity is healthy for our bodies and minds as the body and the mind have a strong connection. It would be difficult to be in a good mood when you are not feeling good about your body.</p>
